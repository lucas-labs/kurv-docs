### Why <b class="font-serif">kurv</b>?

So, why the name <b className="font-serif">kurv</b>? Well, it means _"basket"_ in many languages I don't speak, like Norwegian (but it sounded cool ðŸ˜„). Think of <b className="font-serif">kurv</b> as a basket for your apps. In <b className="font-serif">kurv</b>, we call each deployed app as an `egg`. So, let's go and collect some eggs ðŸ¥š in your basket ðŸ§º.

### Installation

Download the latest release from GitHub. 

**Note**

<b className="font-serif">kurv</b> can run either as a server or as a CLI client, using the same binary. 
The server is responsible for managing the eggs, while the client is used to interact with the server and tell it what to do or ask it for information.

### Testing

Let's see if the installation worked. Run the following command:

```bash
$ kurv --version
```

If you see the version number, you're good to go! ðŸŽ‰
